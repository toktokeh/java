## Big O

### What is big-O
### Why should we care about big-O?

## Java Collections Framework (JCF)
The Java Collections define two fundamental types of data structures. A **Collection** is a grouping of objects, while a **Map** is a set of mappings, or associations, between objects.


## Abstract Data Types (ADTs) vs Data structures
- ADTs are Concerned with behavior and allowed operations
- ADTs are Usually interfaces
- ADT Does not dictate data organization or the implementation. For example, for a list, it does not care whether we use an array to implement the list or a linked list.
- Unlike ADTs, data structures deal with implementation and data storage and organization.

## [ArrayList](./arraylists.md)

## [LinkedList](./linkedlists.md)

## Vectors
- Similar to ArrayLists but thread-safe. Therefore additional overhead is required.

## Iterator, ListIterator, and Iterable interfaces

## Recursion / Backtracking / Divide and conquer


## Maps


## Hash tables


## Sets
- Union
- disjoint
- Kruskal’s)

## Heaps and priority queues

## Stack
- array vs. linked list implementation

## Queue
- Circular queue
- Double-ended class


## Searching
- Linear search
- Binary search

## Sorting
- Selection sort
- Bubble sort
- Insertion sort
- Shellsort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Heap sort
- Radix sort
- Bucket sort

## Trees
- Binary trees
- Binary search trees
- Binary heaps
- Treemap and treeset
- Splay trees
- Prefix trees (tries)
- Expression tree
- Non-binary trees
- Treaps

## Balanced search trees
- AVL trees
- Red-black trees
- B-trees & memory management
- 2-3 trees
- 2-4 trees
- Skip-Lists

## Text processing
- Brute force
- Boyer-Moore
- Knuth-Morris-Pratt
- Rabin-Karp
- Tries
- Suffix trees
- Text compression (Huffman)

## Graphs
- DFS
- BFS
- Shortest path
- Dijkastra’s
- Bellman Ford
- Warshall’s
- Minimal spanning tree

## Greedy algorithms


## Dynamic programming
- Knapsack problem

## NP-completeness
